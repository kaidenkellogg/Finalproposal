Proposal for Final Project: Wizard Collision Game
Project Overview
For my final project, I propose creating a 2D wizard collision-avoidance game using JavaScript and HTML Canvas. The player controls a small wizard character who must avoid touching moving and static obstacles to reach a goal. If the wizard collides with anything, the level restarts immediately.
The game will be heavily inspired by "The World's Hardest Game" from CoolMathGames a game known for its brutally challenging obstacle courses and precision based gameplay.
Related and Similar Work
The World's Hardest Game (CoolMathGames): Its focus on quick reflexes, timing, and simple graphics is the main influence. Geometry Dash: The quick restart cycle and emphasis on player improvement over time.
All of these games share the design philosophy of fast retries, increasing difficulty, and minimalist visuals, which I will emulate.
Anticipated Challenges and New Skills to Learn
•	Collision Detection: I will implement simple bounding box collision detection using JavaScript to detect when the wizard hits an obstacle.
•	Smooth Movement: Ensuring responsive and intuitive movement for the wizard character.
•	Obstacle Behavior: Programming moving obstacles that follow specific paths.
•	Basic Animation: If time allows, animating the wizard’s sprite or using simple frame switches for movement.
Because of the short timeline, I will prioritize functionality first (collision working correctly) before adding extra polish (animations, fancy UI, multiple levels).
Updated Work Plan (Internal Deadlines)
Date	Goal
April 28–29	Finish player movement controls (arrow keys), create wizard sprite (basic shape)
April 30	Implement collision detection with static obstacles
May 1	Add moving obstacles and obstacle collision detection
May 2	Complete level design and winning condition (reaching the goal safely)
May 3	Add restart on collision and basic game loop polish
May 4	Full playtesting, final bug fixes, prepare final project for submission
May 5	Submit final project (NO EXTENSIONS)
